# Genome-Sequence-of-Haemophilus-parainfluenzae-isolated-from-supragingival-plaque

Isolation and growth conditions for the oral isolate Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain EL1

1-	Scrape the supragingival plaque from the buccal face of the molar teeth using a sterile toothpick.
2-	Streak for isolation the sample collected on brain hart infusion (BHI) agar plate supplemented with 5% yeast extract (YE), 7.5mg/mL of hemin, 7.5 mg/mL of NAD, and 5 mg/mL of vancomycin (BHI-YE HP Vanc).
3-	Incubate BHI-YE HP Vanc plate overnight at 37oC, 5% CO2.
4-	Select isolated colonies and streak for isolation again on BHI-YE HP Vanc plate to obtain single isolated colonies.
5-	Incubate plate overnight at 37oC, 5% CO2.
6-	Inoculate one isolate colony in 3 mL of BHI-YE HP.
7-	Incubate culture overnight at 37oC, 5% CO2.
8-	To make stock of the culture, transfer 900ul of overnight culture to a sterile cryovial tube. Add 900 ul of sterile 50% glycerol. Store stock at -80oC.
